Use python to produce code below that will perform the following:

Create a function named domath that will accept 3 parameters.
The function will add the first two parameters and multiply this sum by the third parameter.
You can select the identifiers for each of the parameters.
The resulting product will be returned to the caller.

def domath(num1, num2, num3):
    return((num1 + num2) * num3)
